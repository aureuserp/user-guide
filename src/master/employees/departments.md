# Departments

The **Departments** feature in the **Employees** plugin of **AureusERP** allows an organization to manage and organize its workforce into logical units or teams. Departments help streamline employee management, reporting, and approvals. Each department can have a manager, a parent department (for hierarchy), and be associated with a specific company.

## Department Creation

### Steps to Create a New Department

1. Navigate to **Employees >> Departments >> New Department** as shown below.

## Use Case Example

> **Scenario:** A company named "TechFusion Ltd." has multiple teams like Software Development, QA, Sales, and Support. To manage them efficiently, each is set up as a department. The Sales department reports to the "Business Development" parent department, and each has its own manager for approvals and performance tracking.

Departments help ensure organized reporting, better task allocation, and structured approvals within AureusERP.
