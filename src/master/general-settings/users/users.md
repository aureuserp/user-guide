# Users

A **user** is a person who can sign in to Aureus ERP. Each user has a login, one or more roles, an optional set of teams and a list of companies they can work in. You manage users from the **Users** tab of the Settings app.

> **In simple words:** A user is a login account. Roles and teams decide what that person can see and do.

## Settings

Two options in `Settings → Settings → General → Manage Users` change what you see on this page.

- **Enable User Invitation:** Shows the **Invite User** button on the user list.
- **Enable Reset Password:** Shows the **Change Password** button on the edit page.

You must also set a **Default Company** on that page before you can send an invitation. See [Manage users](./manage-users.md).

## Overview

Open `Settings → Users` to see the list of users.

<!-- TODO-SCREENSHOT: /images1/general-settings/users_list.png | User list with the All Users and Archived Users tabs and the New User and Invite User buttons -->

The list has two tabs:

- **All Users:** Active users, with a count badge.
- **Archived Users:** Deleted users that you can restore, with a count badge.

The list shows these columns:

- **_Avatar:_** The user's picture.
- **_Name:_** The user's full name.
- **_Email:_** The login email.
- **_Teams:_** The teams the user belongs to.

- **_Default Company:_** The company the user works in first.
- **_Allowed Company:_** All companies the user may open.
- **_Created By, Created At, Updated At:_** Hidden at first. Show them from the column menu.

Use the filters **Resource Permission**, **Teams**, **Roles**, **Default Company** and **Allowed Companies** to narrow the list. The newest users appear first.
