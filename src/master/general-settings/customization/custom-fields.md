# Custom fields

A **custom field** is an extra field that you add to a form, such as a quotation, an employee or a product. Use it to store information that the standard form does not ask for. You create the field once, and it then appears on the chosen form, in its list and on its view page.

> **In simple words:** A custom field adds your own box to an existing form, so you can keep the extra details your business needs.

## Overview

Open `Settings → Custom Fields` to see all custom fields.

<!-- TODO-SCREENSHOT: /images1/general-settings/custom_fields_list.png | Custom Fields list with the All and Archived tabs and the Create Field button -->

The list shows these columns:

- **_Code:_** The technical name of the field.
- **_Name:_** The label users see.
- **_Type:_** The kind of input, for example **Text Input** or **Select**.
- **_Resource:_** The form the field belongs to. The class name is shown below it.
- **_Created At:_** When you created the field. The newest field is first.

Use the **All** and **Archived** tabs to switch between active and archived fields. Each tab shows a count. You can search by **Code** or **Name**. You can also filter by **Type** and **Resource**.

## Create a custom field

1. Go to `Settings → Custom Fields`.
2. Click **Create Field**.

**Additional Settings** change the look and help text. Click **Add Setting**, then fill in:

- **_Setting:_** Choose an option, for example **Default Value**, **Placeholder**, **Helper Text**, **Hint** or **Read Only**. The list depends on the field type.
- **_Value:_** Enter the value for that setting. Some settings show a **Color** list instead.

## Where custom fields appear

After you save a field, it shows up in these places on the target form:

- **Form:** The field appears at the end of the create and edit form.
- **List:** The field appears as a column, only when **Use in Table** is on. It is also available in the list filters.
- **View page:** The field appears on the read-only page of the record, styled by the **Infolist Settings**.

::: info
Saving a new field adds a column to the database table of the target form. So the field is ready to use at once.
:::

## Edit, archive and delete a field

Click the three dots at the end of a row to open the menu.

- **_Edit:_** Change the name, options, settings and sort order. You cannot change the locked fields.
- **_Delete:_** Move the field to the **Archived** tab. Records keep their values.
- **_Restore:_** Bring an archived field back.
- **_Force delete:_** Remove the field for good. This also removes its column from the database table.

You can also select several rows and use the bulk actions for restore, delete and force delete.

<!-- TODO-SCREENSHOT: /images1/general-settings/custom_fields_row_menu.png | Row menu on the Custom Fields list showing Edit, Restore, Delete and Force delete -->

::: warning
Force delete cannot be undone. The values stored in that field are lost.
