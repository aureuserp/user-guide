# Companies

A **company** is a legal entity that you run in Aureus ERP. Each company has its own details, address, currency, logo and optional branches. Users are given access to companies, and records are kept per company. You manage companies from the **Companies** tab of the Settings app.

> **In simple words:** A company holds the identity of your business: name, address, currency, logo and branches.

## Overview

Open `Settings → Companies` to see the list of companies.
