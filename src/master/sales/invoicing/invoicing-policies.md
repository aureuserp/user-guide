# Invoicing policies

The invoice policy decides when you can bill a customer for an order line. You can bill by the quantity that was ordered, or by the quantity that was delivered. You set a default for all products, and you can override it on a single product.

> **In simple words:** The invoice policy answers one question: do you bill before delivery or after it?

## Settings

Set the default policy for all products.

1. Go to `Sales → Settings → Manage Invoice`.
2. Under **Invoice Policy**, choose one option:

   - **Ordered Quantities:** You can bill the quantity on the order as soon as it is confirmed. The goods do not need to be delivered first.
   - **Delivered Quantities:** You bill only what has been delivered.

3. Click **Save changes**.

The page shows this help text: **Define how invoices are generated from sales orders.**

## Set the policy on a product

A product can have its own policy. It overrides the default from the settings.

1. Go to `Sales → Products` and open a product, or click **New Product**.
2. In the **Invoice Policy** section, choose **Ordered Quantities** or **Delivered Quantities**.
3. Click **Save changes**, or **Create** on a new product.

The form shows this help text: **You can invoice goods before they are delivered.** It describes the **Ordered Quantities** choice.

## Which policy applies

For each order line, the app checks in this order:

1. The **Invoice Policy** on the product.
2. The **Invoice Policy** on the parent product, if the line uses a variant.
3. The default policy in **Manage Invoice**.

## How the policy changes the invoice status

- With **Ordered Quantities**, a confirmed order line is ready to bill at once. The order shows in **Orders To Invoice**.
- With **Delivered Quantities**, a line is ready to bill when its goods are delivered.

::: tip
Use **Delivered Quantities** when you want to bill only what you shipped. Use **Ordered Quantities** for services or prepaid goods.
