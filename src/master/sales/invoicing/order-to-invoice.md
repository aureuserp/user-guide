# Orders to invoice

The **Orders To Invoice** page lists the confirmed sales orders that are ready to be billed. Use it as your billing worklist. You open an order from it and create the customer invoice.

> **In simple words:** This page shows every order that is waiting for an invoice.

## Overview

Go to `Sales → To Invoice → Orders To Invoice`.

The list has these views:

- **Default:** All orders ready to invoice.
- **My Orders:** Only your orders.
- **Archived:** Archived orders.

The list shows these columns:

- **Number:** The order number, for example `SO/3`.
- **Creation Date:** The date the order was created.
- **Customer:** The customer on the order.
- **Sales Person:** The person who owns the order.
- **Amount Total:** The order total.
- **Status:** The order status. Orders in this list show **Sales Order**.

A summary row at the bottom shows the **Total Amount** of the listed orders.

You can search, group and filter the list. Use **Group by** for **Medium**, **Source**, **Team**, **Sales Person**, **Currency**, **Company**, **Customer**, **Quotation Date** or **Commitment Date**. For more help, see [Search, filter and group](../../getting-started/search-filter-group.md).

::: info
An order appears here when its invoice status is **To Invoice**. The invoice policy sets when that happens. See [Invoicing policies](invoicing-policies.md).
