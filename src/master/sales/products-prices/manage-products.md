# Manage products

A product is any good or service you sell. You pick products when you build a quotation. The product holds the price, the cost, the taxes and the invoice policy that the order line uses.

## Settings

- **Unit of Measure:** Allow products to have a unit of measure.
- **Packagings:** Allow products to have multiple packagings.
