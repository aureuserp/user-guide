# Price lists

A price list holds pricing rules for a currency. Use price lists to sell the same product at different prices, for example to wholesale and retail customers. You can pick a price list on a quotation.

> **In simple words:** A price list is a set of rules that decide the selling price.

The **Price Lists** page shows only when the feature is on.

## Add a price rule

The first rule that matches a product decides its price. More specific rules win over broader ones.

1. Under **Price Rules**, click **Add Rule**.
2. Fill in the rule window:

   - **_Apply To:_** Choose **All Products**, **Category**, **Product** or **Variant**. Then choose the category, product or variant.
   - **_Min Qty:_** Set the smallest quantity for the rule.
   - **_Validity Period_** and **_End Date:_** Set when the rule is active.
   - **_Price Type:_** Choose **Fixed Price**, **Discount** or **Formula**.

3. Complete the fields for the price type:

   - **Fixed Price:** Enter the **Fixed Price**.
   - **Discount:** Enter the **Discount** percentage and choose what it is based on. Use a negative value to apply a mark-up.
   - **Formula:** Choose the **Based price**: **Sales Price**, **Cost** or **Other Price List**. Then set **Discount** or **Markup**, **Round off to**, **Extra Fee**, **Min. Margin** and **Max. Margin**.

4. Save the rule.

The rules table shows **Apply On**, **Applies To**, **Min. Quantity**, **Compute Price**, **Price** and **Period**. Click **Edit Rule** on a row to change it.

## Use a price list on a quotation

On a quotation, choose the list in **Price List**. The field shows only when **Price Lists** is on. The quotation currency follows the price list.
