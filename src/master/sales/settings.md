# Settings – Roles & Permissions | Sales Plugin

Before accessing any functionality in the **Sales Plugin**, permissions must be granted to user roles. This ensures that only authorized users can view or manage customer data, quotations, sales orders, and related records.

## 🔐 Managing Roles & Permissions

Navigate to **`Settings → Roles → [Select Role] → Edit`** as shown in the image below.
