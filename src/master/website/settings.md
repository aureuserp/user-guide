# Settings – Website Plugin

The **Settings** section in the **Website Plugin** of **AureusERP** allows you to control what contact information and social media links are displayed on your website. These settings help visitors get in touch with you or follow your business on different platforms. This guide explains how to update the contact details and manage access permissions.

## Manage Contact

1. Navigate to **Settings >> Settings >> Website >> Manage Contact**

   #### Contact Section

   This section lets you add or update your official contact details:

   - **Email:** The email address shown under the **Contact Us** section on the website.
   - **Phone:** The phone number displayed to users for support or inquiries.

   These contact details will be directly visible to visitors at the bottom of your website.

   #### Social Links Section

   You can connect your website to social media accounts by entering only the **username** of each account. The system automatically attaches the proper social media domain (e.g., facebook.com/username).

   The available platforms include:

   - **Twitter**
   - **Facebook**
   - **Instagram**
   - **WhatsApp**
   - **YouTube**
   - **LinkedIn**
   - **Pinterest**
   - **TikTok**
   - **GitHub**
   - **Slack**

   These social media icons appear under the **Follow Us** section on your website. Clicking an icon will redirect users to the corresponding social media page.

2. **Save Changes**

Click **Save Changes** after updating your contact details and social links. The changes are reflected immediately on the website frontend.
