# Blog Post

The **Blog Posts** module in the **Website Plugin** of **AureusERP** allows users to create, manage, and publish content to the website. Blog posts help your organization share updates, educational content, or promotional material with website visitors. Each post can include content, images, metadata, and SEO tags for better visibility. This guide covers the step-by-step process of creating a blog post and making it live on your site.

   ### General Section

   - **_Title:_** Enter a clear and attractive title for your blog post. This is the main heading displayed to users.
   - **_Slug:_** Auto-generated based on the title. This is the URL path of the blog post.
   - **_Sub Title:_** A short subtitle that appears below the main title on the blog post.
   - **_Content:_** Add the main content of your blog post. You can use formatting (bold, italics, lists, etc.) for better readability.
   - **_Banner:_** Upload an image that will be used as the banner or featured image for the blog post.

   ### Settings Section

   - **_Category:_** Select the category under which this blog post should be listed (e.g., News, Updates, Tutorials).
   - **_Tags:_** Assign relevant keywords or topics. Tags help in organizing and filtering blog posts.

   ### SEO Section

   These fields are important for search engine visibility.

   - **_Meta Title:_** The title shown on search engine result pages (SERPs). It should be concise and descriptive.
   - **_Meta Keywords:_** A comma-separated list of keywords relevant to the blog post.
   - **_Meta Description:_** A brief summary that appears in search results under the title. It should be within 150–160 characters.

3. Action Buttons

   At the bottom of the form, you will find:

   - **Create:** Save and publish the blog post as a draft.
   - **Create & Create Another:** Save current blog and open a new post form.
   - **Cancel:** Exit without saving.

## After Creating a Blog Post

Once the blog is created, the system redirects you to the **View Blog Post** page.

From here, you can:

- **Edit Post:** Make changes to the blog's content, settings, or SEO metadata.
- **Delete Post:** Permanently remove the blog post.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Creating a blog post does **not** automatically publish it on the website.

## How to Publish the Blog Post

To make your blog post publicly visible:

1. Click on **Edit Post** from the **View Blog** page.
2. On the top-right corner of the **Edit Blog Post** page, click on **Publish**.
3. After enabling publish, click **Save** to apply the changes.

Once published, the blog post becomes visible on the website's frontend under the appropriate category.

## Summary

Creating a blog in the **Website Plugin** allows you to:

- Share valuable content with your audience

- Control visibility and categorization of each post

Ensure that your post is **published** after creation to make it live on the website.
