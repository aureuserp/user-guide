# Pages

The **Pages** module in the **Website** plugin of **AureusERP** allows users to create, manage, and publish static pages on their ERP-powered website. These pages can include content like "About Us", "Privacy Policy", "Contact", or any custom informational content.

## Creating a New Page

### Steps to Create a New Page

1. Navigate to **Website >> Pages >> New Page** as shown in the below image.

By default, two pages are already created:

- **Home**
- **Blogs**

2. Fill in the form as per the following sections:

   ### General Section

   - **_Title:_** The main name of the page that will appear on the frontend (e.g., About Us, Terms & Conditions).
   - **_Slug:_** Auto-generated based on the title. This becomes the URL path of your page.
   - **_Content:_** Add the main body content of your page. It supports rich text formatting, embedded links, and media.

   ### Settings Section

   - **_Is Visible Header Menu:_** Toggle ON if the page should be shown in the website’s top menu.
   - **_Is Visible Footer Menu:_** Toggle ON if the page should be listed in the website footer.

   ### SEO Section

   - **_Meta Title:_** This appears on search engine results as the clickable headline.
   - **_Meta Keywords:_** Keywords relevant to your page (comma-separated).
   - **_Meta Description:_** A short summary of the page content for SEO. Keep it under 160 characters.

3. Action Buttons

   At the bottom of the form, you will find:

- **Create**: Save and create the page.
- **Create & Create Another**: Save and open a new blank form.
- **Cancel**: Exit without saving.

## After Page Creation

After clicking **Create**, the system redirects you to the **View Page** screen.

From here, you can:

- **Edit Post**: Update the page content, settings, or SEO information.
- **Delete**: Permanently remove the page.

## Publishing the Page

> ⚠️ Creating a page does **not** publish it immediately on the live website.

### To publish the page:

1. Click on **Edit Post** from the **View Page** screen.
2. On the top-right corner of the **Edit Page** screen, click on **Publish**.
3. Click **Save** to apply your changes.

Once published, the page will become visible in either the **header** or **footer** section depending on the toggles selected during creation.
