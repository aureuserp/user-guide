# Configurations

The **Configurations** section of the **Website Plugin** in **AureusERP** allows users to manage global settings like **Categories** and **Tags**. These configurations are essential for organizing content such as blog posts and pages in a structured and searchable way.

## Category Creation

Categories help group blog posts under common topics. Every blog post should be assigned to a category to maintain a clear content hierarchy.

### Steps to Create a Category

1. Navigate to **`Website → Configurations → Categories`**.

2. Click on **New Category**. A modal form will appear with the following fields:

   - **_Name:_** Enter a unique name for the category (e.g., News, Updates, Tutorials).
   - **_Slug:_** Auto-generated based on the name; used in the blog post URL.
   - **_Sub Title:_** Optional subtitle for the category.

> **Note:** Category names must be **unique** to avoid conflicts.

3. Action Buttons

- **Create:** Save the category and close the modal.
- **Create & Create Another:** Save current category and open a new form.
- **Cancel:** Exit without saving changes.

## Tags Creation

Tags help in filtering and organizing blog posts based on specific keywords or topics. They are useful for search and categorization.

### Steps to Create a Tag

1. Navigate to **`Website → Configurations → Tags`**.

2. Click on **New Tag**. A modal will open with the following fields:

   - **_Name:_** Enter a relevant tag name (e.g., HR, Sales, Launch).
   - **_Color:_** Pick a color to visually represent this tag.

3. Action Buttons

- **Create:** Save the tag and close the modal.
- **Create & Create Another:** Save the tag and open a new form.
- **Cancel:** Exit without saving changes.

## Summary

- **Categories** are used to group blog posts into structured topics.
- **Tags** help label and filter posts for better organization and searchability.

Both configurations improve the **frontend display** and **backend management** of content in the **Website Plugin** of **AureusERP**.
