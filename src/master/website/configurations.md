# Configurations

The **Configurations** section of the **Website Plugin** in **AureusERP** allows users to manage global settings like **Categories** and **Tags**. These configurations are essential for organizing content such as blog posts and pages in a structured and searchable way.

## Category

> **Why it's used:** Categories help group blog posts under common topics. Every blog post should be assigned to a category to maintain a clear content hierarchy.

### Category Creation Steps
