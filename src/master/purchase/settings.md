2. You will see the following fields:

   - **_Purchase Order Approval:_** When enabled, purchase orders exceeding a specific **minimum amount** will require approval from a manager before confirmation. This ensures better control over high-value purchases.

   - **_Minimum Amount:_** Define the threshold amount for which a purchase order must be approved.  
     Example: If set to ₹10,000, any order above this amount will need manager approval.

   - **_Lock Confirmed Orders:_** When enabled, once a purchase order is confirmed, it cannot be edited. This helps prevent accidental changes after finalization.

   - **_Purchase Agreements:_** Enable this option to manage **Blanket Orders** and **Purchase Templates**. Blanket Orders help in long-term agreements with suppliers, while Purchase Templates simplify repetitive order creation.

   - **_Packagings:_** Enable to manage product packaging details, such as a pack of 6 bottles or a box of 10 pieces. This helps in tracking inventory and purchases based on packaging type.

3. Action Button
