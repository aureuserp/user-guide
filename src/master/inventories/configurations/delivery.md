# Delivery

The Delivery section in the Inventory module helps you configure how products are packaged and prepared for shipment. This setup ensures smooth warehouse and logistics operations by defining package types used during packing, transfers, and delivery.

## Package Types

Package Types define the physical characteristics of packages like boxes, cartons, pallets, or envelopes used to ship or store products. Creating package types helps warehouse users assign the right container during packing and shipment operations.

**Use Case:** Use package types to standardize packaging sizes, weights, and categories for proper shipment handling, tracking, and storage optimization.

### Steps to Create a Package Type
