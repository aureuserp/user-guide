# Stages

**Stages** show how far a record has moved through a process. A maintenance request moves from new to repaired. A job application moves from first contact to hired. A task moves from to do to done. Stages are the same idea in every module, so you learn them once.

> **In simple words:** A stage is a step on the way to finished. You decide the steps, and you move each record from one step to the next.

## Where stages are used

| Module | Stages for | Menu path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Maintenance | Maintenance requests | `Maintenance → Configurations → Stages` |
| Recruitment | Job applications | `Recruitment → Configuration → Stages` |
| Project | Projects | `Project → Configurations → Project Stages` |
| Project | Tasks | `Project → Configurations → Task Stages` |

::: info
Project stages are off by default. Turn them on before you use them. See [Turn on project stages](#turn-on-project-stages).
:::

## Change stages

Every stage page works the same way:

1. Open the menu path from the table above.
2. Click **New** to add a stage, or click **Edit** on a row to change one.
3. Fill in the fields and save.

The list shows the stages in the order they appear in the process. To change the order, use the drag handle on a row and drop it in its new place. Click **Delete** to remove a stage.

::: warning
A stage that is still used by records cannot always be deleted. Move those records to another stage first.

## Fields by module
