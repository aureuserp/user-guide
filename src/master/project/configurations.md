# Configuration

Configurations are a vital part of the **Project Plugin** in AureusERP. They help define workflows, organize tasks, and manage various elements efficiently. These configurations directly influence project and task creation, progress tracking, and activity planning. Below is a detailed guide for each configuration section.

Project stages represent the lifecycle or progression steps of a project. They help in tracking where the project currently stands (e.g., Planning, In Progress, Completed).
